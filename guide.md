## States of Motivation
There are 5 states within that specturm that you can sit in:
- **Stagnant:** Nothing is motivating you to pursue your goal.
- **Avoiding Failure:** A fear of failure is motivating you to take action. You are worried that if you don't you will fail.
- **Chasing Success:** You feel like you are likely to achieve your goal and the thought of success motivates you to keep on going.
- **Upgrading Goal:** You feel like success is garenteed. Depending on the importance of the goal, this state is correlated with a feeling of deep happiness and euphoria. You are now looking past your goal and thinking about what you will do after you succeed.
- **Saving What You Can:** You feel like failure is garenteed. Depending on the importance of the goal, this state is correlated with denial and grief. You are likely trying to find any way to save what is left after you fail.

Understanding these states and where you lie within its spectrum allows you to predict how the next action you take will cause a certain emotion. Knowing this, you now have ability to choose the best action that moves the needle in your favor.

## Using the framework within the tool

For every goal that you have, click the '+' button in your dashboard to create a new motivation scale to help you measure your motivation in achieving that goal. 

A modal will pop up. That modal will contain 3 inputs:
1. **Goal:** What goal you are trying to achieve.
2. **Chasing Success Metrics:** The things that need to happen in order for you to feel like you are in a state of chasing succcess.
3. **Avoiding Failure Metrics:** The things that need to happen in order for you to feel like you are falling into a state of avoiding failure.

Once you filled in the inputs and pressed the 'create scale' button, a scale will pop up in your dashboard containing all the information you added to the modal. Every time your mood changes, look at all the goals you have and see which ones caused this mood shift and use that information to shift the slider to the state you think it is in. The more you do this the more your knowledge in yourself and your emotions will grow, thus allowing you to gain more control over them and achieve your goals on your terms!
